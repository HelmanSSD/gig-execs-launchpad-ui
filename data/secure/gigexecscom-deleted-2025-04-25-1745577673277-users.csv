I then aligned the plan with C-suite and senior management global requirements and financial objectives. The CEO and CFO accepted the program in September 2017, projecting a 10% ROI by reducing year-over-year operating expenses at the end of three years.

Results: A capital project with ROI, complete with a contingency plan to minimize risk if a failure occurred before it was replaced, was approved and implemented before a catastrophic outage occurred.\n\nThe Canadian facility was not compliant with current OH&S and Z462 arc flash and zero-energy safety standards. Results: I worked with the safety manager to ensure the facility complied with ALL safety regulations and insurance guidelines. \n\nI directed the Facility & Energy Management team to develop and implement an energy management strategy to track energy usage, carbon emissions, and equipment health on all building systems (HVAC, boilers, chillers, fans etc.) and high usage production systems in real-time.

Over the years she had worked within our team, her contract role had evolved from Entero backup and system administration to a much wider portfolio of assumed responsibilities.  Over time she assumed the responsibility for a portfolio of Government reporting activities, primarily due to her knowledge and understanding of the oil and gas industry and her strong excel skillset. Most recently she had become fully engaged with the implementation of the Bourque application within our rail logistics team.   I would consider her to be one of our SME’s, subject matter experts on the project team and a key valuable resource during that integration.   Most recently she was also heavily involved in the development of some of our new reporting requirements and formats that came out of the Bourque system implementation.  \n\nSheri-lyn’s skillset and work ethic are second to none.  She is an extremely logical and meticulous person, with great attention to detail and an outstanding work ethic.  She worked daily with large volumes of data and was able to reconcile, segregate and categorize data for us through the use of her strong excel skills.   Aside from her systems aptitude she was also providing guidance and support to some of the junior members of our team.   Her commitment to the success of our team could also be seen in her aptitude and desire to find the correct answer to pending questions.  \n\nI would strongly recommend Sheri-lyn for her detailed and meticulous nature, her solid commitment to a job well done, her technical skills, as well as her reliable nature.   She would be a strong candidate for any role that requires critical thinking with a systems aptitude.  \n"",""email"":""kwilliams@pembina.com"",""firstName"":""Karen"",""lastName"":""Williams"",""phoneNumber"":""+14036699919""}]}",null,active

My personal goal during this time was to train and grow the junior designer and shaping the individual into a mid- level designer.\nA strong capability of mine is to understand the company over strategic visions and create an environment with the team where our goals and objectives fed back into the company vision. My success in this was to provide the team with the right tools in order for them to track their successes from a target point of view and use data to drive their overall decision making. My actionable aim was to create meaningful digital journeys that resonated with clients but also lead us to reach our business objectives and goals.\nMy greatest achievement during my time at Nedbank was introducing the chatbot to onto a new channel. From creating the design system and style guides, drafting a release strategy for our approach, adopting the right content strategy, researching and competitor analysis among the many other tasks that needed to be done to get this off the ground. The project was a success and currently implemented onto the Nedbank.co.za website.\nApart from the design led tasks, I was also instrumental in creating marketing content together with the marketing team on a number of key strategic approaches.

# Client Onboarding System Implementation

## Overview
The Client Onboarding System follows the same structure and concept as the Consultant Onboarding, providing a streamlined 4-step process for clients to set up their company profiles on GigExecs.

## System Architecture

### Routes
- `/onboarding/client/step1` - LinkedIn vs Manual selection
- `/onboarding/client/step2` - Personal profile setup
- `/onboarding/client/step3` - Company profile setup  
- `/onboarding/client/review` - Final review and submission

### Database Tables Used
- `users` - Basic user information (first_name, last_name, profile_photo_url)
- `client_profiles` - Company and business information
- `industries` - Available industries dropdown
- `countries` - Available countries dropdown

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Onboarding Method Selection
**File**: `src/app/onboarding/client/step1.tsx`

**Features**:
- LinkedIn import option (placeholder for future implementation)
- Manual input option
- Progress indicator (1 of 4 steps)
- Consistent UI with consultant onboarding

**Database Operations**: None (selection only)

### Step 2: Personal Profile
**File**: `src/app/onboarding/client/step2.tsx`

**Fields**:
- Profile Photo (optional) → `users.profile_photo_url`
- First Name* → `users.first_name`

- Progress indicator (2 of 4 steps)

**Database Operations**:
- Update `users` table with personal information
- Upsert `client_profiles` table with job title

### Step 3: Company Profile
**File**: `src/app/onboarding/client/step3.tsx`

**Fields**:
- Company Name* → `client_profiles.company_name`
- Website (optional) → `client_profiles.website`
- D-U-N-S Number (optional) → `client_profiles.duns_number`

## Database Schema Mapping

### Users Table
```sql

```

### Client Profiles Table
```sql
client_profiles.user_id → User ID (foreign key)

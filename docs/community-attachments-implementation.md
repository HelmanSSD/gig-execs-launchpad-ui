# Community Attachments Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

This document describes the implementation of the attachment system for community posts, allowing users to upload and share files, images, and documents within the community forum.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Functionality
- **File Uploads**: Support for multiple file types (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, images, text files)
- **File Size Limits**: 5MB maximum per file
- **Multiple Attachments**: Users can attach multiple files to a single post
- **File Type Detection**: Automatic icon and label generation based on file type
- **Image Previews**: Thumbnail previews for image attachments
- **Download Support**: Users can download attachments directly from posts

### ✅ UI Components
- **Attachment Tiles**: Individual file display with icons, names, and sizes
- **Attachments Carousel**: Horizontal scrollable display for multiple attachments
- **Remove Controls**: Hover-to-reveal remove buttons (X) for post creation
- **Tooltips**: "Add attachment" tooltip on the paperclip icon
- **Upload Progress**: Visual feedback during file uploads

### ✅ Storage & Security
- **Supabase Storage**: Dedicated `community-attachments` bucket
- **User Isolation**: Files organized by user ID for security
- **Public Read Access**: Attachments are publicly viewable
- **Authenticated Uploads**: Only logged-in users can upload files
- **Owner Deletion**: Users can only delete their own attachments

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
The attachment data is stored in the `forum_posts` table as a JSON array in the `attachments` field:

```typescript
interface ForumAttachment {
  id?: string;
  type: 'file' | 'link' | 'image' | 'video';
  url: string;
  title?: string;
  description?: string;
  // File-specific fields
  fileName?: string;
  fileSize?: number;
  mimeType?: string;
  storagePath?: string;
  uploadedAt?: string;
}
```

### Storage Bucket Configuration
- **Bucket Name**: `community-attachments`
- **File Size Limit**: 5MB
- **Public Access**: Yes (for viewing)
- **Allowed MIME Types**: Images, PDFs, Office documents, text files

### File Organization
```
community-attachments/
├── {user-id-1}/
│   ├── 1703123456789_document.pdf
│   └── 1703123456790_image.jpg
├── {user-id-2}/

```

2. Add various file types as attachments
3. Verify attachments display correctly
4. Test file downloads
5. Check that file size limits are enforced

## 🔒 Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)

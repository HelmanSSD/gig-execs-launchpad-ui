# Client Onboarding Dashboard Integration

## Overview
The Client Onboarding system is fully integrated with the dashboard profile completeness tracking, providing multiple entry points and real-time progress updates.

## ðŸŽ¯ Profile Completeness Integration

### Database Field
- **`users.profile_complete_pct`** - Tracks completion percentage (0-100)
- **Default Value**: 0 (new users)
- **Completion Value**: 100 (after onboarding completion)

### Real-Time Updates
- Dashboard displays current completion percentage from database
- Progress bar updates automatically
- No hardcoded values - always shows actual progress

## ðŸš€ Launch Points

### 1. Profile Completeness Card (Primary)
**Location**: Dashboard stats grid (top right)
**Behavior**: 
- Shows current completion percentage
- Clickable card that routes to appropriate onboarding
- **Consultants**: Routes to `/onboarding/step1`
- **Clients**: Routes to `/onboarding/client/step1`

### 2. Quick Actions Section (Secondary)
**Location**: Dashboard Quick Actions (below stats)
**Behavior**:
- Only appears when `profile_complete_pct < 100`
- Prominent yellow button with "Complete Profile" text
- Shows remaining percentage (e.g., "25% remaining")
- Routes to appropriate onboarding based on user role

### 3. Direct URL Access
**Routes Available**:
- `/onboarding/client/step1` - Client onboarding start
- `/onboarding/client/step2` - Personal profile
- `/onboarding/client/step3` - Company profile
- `/onboarding/client/review` - Final review

  if (user.role === 'consultant') {
    navigate('/onboarding/step1');
  } else {
    navigate('/onboarding/client/step1');
  }
}}
```

### Profile Completion Update

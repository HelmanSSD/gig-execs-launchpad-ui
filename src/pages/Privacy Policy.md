   * **Disclosure of Personal Information for Business Purposes or Commercial Purposes**  
     We may use or disclose and may have used or disclosed in the last twelve (12) months the following categories of personal information for business or commercial purposes:  
     * Category A: Identifiers  
     * Category B: Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e))  
     * Category D: Commercial information

   * **Sale of Personal Information**  
     As defined in the CCPA, "sell" and "sale" mean selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer's personal information by the business to a third party for valuable consideration. This means that We may have received some kind of benefit in return for sharing personal information, but not necessarily a monetary benefit.  
     Please note that the categories listed below are those defined in the CCPA. This does not mean that all examples of that category of personal information were in fact sold, but reflects our good faith belief to the best of our knowledge that some of that information from the applicable category may be and may have been shared for value in return.  
     We may sell and may have sold in the last twelve (12) months the following categories of personal information:  
     * Category A: Identifiers  
     * Category B: Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e))  
     * Category D: Commercial information  
     * Category F: Internet or other similar network activity  
   * **Share of Personal Information**  
     We may share Your personal information identified in the above categories with the following categories of third parties:  
     * Service Providers  
     * Payment processors  
     * Our affiliates  
     * Our business partners  
     * Third party vendors to whom You or Your agents authorise Us to disclose Your personal information in connection with products or services We provide to You  
   * **Sale of Personal Information of Minors Under 16 Years of Age**  
     We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under the age of 16 through our Service, although certain third party websites that we link to may do so. These third-party websites have their own terms of use and privacy policies and we encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and instruct their children to never provide information on other websites without their permission.  
     We do not sell the personal information of Consumers We actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless We receive affirmative authorization (the "right to opt-in") from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to the sale of personal information may opt- out of future sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt-out, You (or Your authorized representative) may submit a request to Us by contacting Us.  
     If You have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 (or 16\) has provided Us with personal information, please contact Us with sufficient detail to enable Us to delete that information.
